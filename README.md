# React Shopping Cart

This project is a simple shopping cart application built using Preact, a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API. It allows users to browse through a list of products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

## Features

- Browse through a list of products
- Add products to the shopping cart
- Adjust the quantity of products in the cart
- Remove products from the cart
- Calculate total price including taxes and shipping
- Proceed to checkout with the option for payment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/preact-shopping-cart.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd preact-shopping-cart
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server:

```
npm start
```

This will run the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

This will create a `build` directory with optimized production-ready code.
